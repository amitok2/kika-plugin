# Lifted out of capture.sh when a second hook needed it. Two copies of a
# credential search is two copies that drift, and the one that drifts is the one
# nobody notices — a hook that silently finds no token looks exactly like a hook
# with nothing to say.
#
# Sourced, not executed. Sets TOKEN, empty when there is nothing to find.
# Callers must treat empty as "exit quietly": an uninstalled or unauthenticated
# setup has to cost nothing and say nothing.

# You configured the MCP server with a token. Asking for a second one — an env
# var, a dotfile — for the half of the product that runs three seconds later is
# friction we invented, not friction the design requires. So this reads the
# Authorization header out of the MCP configuration itself.
#
# The result is that the whole install is one command:
#
#   claude mcp add --transport http kika https://api.getkika.app/mcp \
#     --header "Authorization: Bearer kika_mcp_…"
#
# Looked for in the order Claude Code resolves MCP servers: a project .mcp.json
# first, then the per-project section of ~/.claude.json, then the global one.
# The cwd may be a subdirectory of the project root, so parents are walked.
# Where Claude Code keeps its files. CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR moves all of it —
# settings, history, plugins — and a hook that hardcodes ~/.claude finds nothing
# for anyone who has set it. On Windows ~/.claude is %USERPROFILE%\.claude, so
# the same path works there under Git Bash.

# Say why nothing happened, when asked. Capture is silent by design — a hook

# also means someone whose capture never fires has no way to find out. This is
# the way out, and it goes to stderr so it can never contaminate a hook whose
# stdout is injected as context.
